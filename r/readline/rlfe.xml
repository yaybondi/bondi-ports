        <summary>Front-end using readline to "cook" input lines for other programs</summary>
        <p>
        This tool lets you use history and line-editing in any text oriented
        tool. This is especially useful with third-party proprietary tools that
        cannot be distributed linked against readline. It is not perfect but it
        works pretty well.

        See the ledit and rlwrap packages for other programs of that kind.
