            <summary>A non-preemptive threads implementation</summary>
            <p>
            nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very
            similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a
            replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In
            contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads
            implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not
            compatible to GNU Pth.
