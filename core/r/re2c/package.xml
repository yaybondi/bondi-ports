            <summary>lexer generator for C, C++ and Go</summary>
            <p>
            re2c's main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as
            their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using
            a traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated
            finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and
            comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller
            than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug
            and understand. Quite a few optimizations are applied in order to
            speed up and compress the generated code.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of
            assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write
            most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any
            particular environment.
            </p>
