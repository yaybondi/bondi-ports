        <p>
        GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
        processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
        extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
        macros). `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
        shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc. Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
        generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.
