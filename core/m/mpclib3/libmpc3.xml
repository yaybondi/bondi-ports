        <summary>Multiple precision complex floating-point library</summary>
        <p>
        MPC is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision
        arithmetic on complex numbers providing correct rounding. For the time
        being, it contains all arithmetic operations over complex numbers, the
        exponential and the logarithm functions, the trigonometric and
        hyperbolic functions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ultimately, it should implement a multiprecision equivalent of the ISO
        C99 standard.
        </p>
        <p>
        It builds upon the GNU MP and the MPFR libraries.
