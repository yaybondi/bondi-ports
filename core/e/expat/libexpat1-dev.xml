        <p>
        This package contains the header file and development libraries of
        expat, the C library for parsing XML. Expat is a stream oriented XML
        parser. This means that you register handlers with the parser prior
        to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the parser
        discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
        start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
        register handlers.
