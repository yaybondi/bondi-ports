        <summary>High-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities</summary>
        <p>
        bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
        It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
        techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
        times faster at decompression.
        </p>
        <p>
        bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
        compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
        considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
        LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
        family of statistical compressors.
        </p>
        <p>
        The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
        predecessor, bzip (.bz).
