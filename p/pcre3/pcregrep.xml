        <summary>grep utility that uses perl 5 compatible regexes.</summary>
        <p>
        Perl-style regexps have many useful features that the standard POSIX ones
        don't; this is basically the same as grep but with the different
        regexp syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other reason for the existence of pcregrep is that its source code is an
        example of programming with libpcre.
